This game requires there to be two decks of cards, one for player one and another for player two.
The game involves both players playing the top card of their deck and determining who's card is
higher in rank. The player who's card is higher in rank gets to take both of the cards and add
them to their deck. If the player's cards are equal in rank, then they go to war. This means each
player lays down an additional three cards and the last card to be revealedis compared. The player
with the highest rank of this last card gets all the cards currently in play. If a tie happens
agina, this is repeated until a winner is eventually decided upon. The game keeps going until one
player is out of cards and loses.
